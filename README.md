# Driver Drowsiness Detection and Remote Monitoring System

The number of vehicles is increasing day by day, and the increase in unconscious drivers and not obeying traffic rules increases traffic accidents. Common mistakes of drivers; can be summarized as excessive speeding, exceeding the following distance, insomnia and carelessness. It is critical to keep drivers awake while driving in order to prevent or reduce the number of accidents. In this graduation project, it is aimed to fix the errors of the driver drowsiness detection system made in the design project and to add new features. For more detailed and instant data transfer, transferring the data received via RaspberryPi to both a cloud system and a web-android mobile application is among the priority targets. Real-time camera data will be transferred live to the cloud system by creating a cloud database system. The system will be able to give the driver (GPS) information such as location information, distance traveled by the vehicle, travel time, weather conditions, wind speed, address information, traffic density, and maximum braking distance according to weather conditions...
